# WakeOnLan Pi

WakeOnLan Pi is a lightweight .NET web application that exposes a simple REST API for sending **Wake-on-LAN (WOL)** packets from a Raspberry Pi to devices on your local network.  

This allows you to remotely power on servers, desktops, or other devices without needing direct access to the machine.
